          DNS rebinding protection was ineffective when BIND 9 is configured as
          a forwarding DNS server. Found and responsibly reported by Tobias
          Klein. [GL #1574]

          We have received reports that in some circumstances, receipt of an
          IXFR can cause the processing of queries to slow significantly. Some
          of these are related to RPZ processing, others appear to occur where
          there are NSEC3-related changes (such as an operator changing the
          NSEC3 salt used in the hash calculation). These are being
          investigated.  [GL #1685]
