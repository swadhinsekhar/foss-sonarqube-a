          Two new update policy rule types have been added
          <command>krb5-selfsub</command> and <command>ms-selfsub</command>
          which allow machines with Kerberos principals to update
          the name space at or below the machine names identified
          in the respective principals.

          The <command>rndc nta</command> command could not differentiate
          between views of the same name but different class; this
          has been corrected with the addition of a <command>-class</command>
          option. [GL #105]

        <para>
          When a negative trust anchor was added to multiple views
          using <command>rndc nta</command>, the text returned via
          <command>rndc</command> was incorrectly truncated after the
          first line, making it appear that only one NTA had been
          added. This has been fixed. [GL #105]
