        <para>
          The default value of <command>max-recursion-queries</command> was
          increased from 75 to 100. Since the queries sent towards root and TLD
          servers are now included in the count (as a result of the fix for
          CVE-2020-8616), <command>max-recursion-queries</command> has a higher
          chance of being exceeded by non-attack queries, which is the main
          reason for increasing its default value. [GL #2305]
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The default value of <command>nocookie-udp-size</command> was restored
          back to 4096 bytes. Since <command>max-udp-size</command> is the upper
          bound for <command>nocookie-udp-size</command>, this change relieves
          the operator from having to change
          <command>nocookie-udp-size</command> together with
          <command>max-udp-size</command> in order to increase the default EDNS
          buffer size limit. <command>nocookie-udp-size</command> can still be
          set to a value lower than <command>max-udp-size</command>, if desired.

          The CNAME synthesized from a DNAME was incorrectly followed when the
