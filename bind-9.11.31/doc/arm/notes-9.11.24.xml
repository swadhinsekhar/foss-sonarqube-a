           DNS Flag Day 2020: The default EDNS buffer size has been changed from
           4096 to 1232 bytes. According to measurements done by multiple
           parties, this should not cause any operational problems as most of
           the Internet "core" is able to cope with IP message sizes between
           1400-1500 bytes; the 1232 size was picked as a conservative minimal
           number that could be changed by the DNS operator to an estimated path
           MTU minus the estimated header space. In practice, the smallest MTU
           witnessed in the operational DNS community is 1500 octets, the
           maximum Ethernet payload size, so a useful default for maximum
           DNS/UDP payload size on reliable networks would be 1400 bytes.
