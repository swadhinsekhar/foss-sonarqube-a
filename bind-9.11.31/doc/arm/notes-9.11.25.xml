          <command>named</command> acting as a resolver could incorrectly treat
          signed zones with no DS record at the parent as bogus. Such zones
          should be treated as insecure. This has been fixed. [GL #2236]

          After a Negative Trust Anchor (NTA) is added, BIND performs periodic
          checks to see if it is still necessary. If BIND encountered a failure
          while creating a query to perform such a check, it attempted to
          dereference a NULL pointer, resulting in a crash. [GL #2244]

          A problem obtaining glue records could prevent a stub zone from
          functioning properly, if the authoritative server for the zone were
          configured for minimal responses. [GL #1736]
