          To prevent exhaustion of server resources by a maliciously configured
          domain, the number of recursive queries that can be triggered by a
          request before aborting recursion has been further limited. Root and
          top-level domain servers are no longer exempt from the
          <command>max-recursion-queries</command> limit. Fetches for missing
          name server address records are limited to 4 for any domain. This
          issue was disclosed in CVE-2020-8616. [GL #1388]

          Replaying a TSIG BADTIME response as a request could

          When running on a system with support for Linux capabilities,
          <command>named</command> drops root privileges very soon after system
          startup. This was causing a spurious log message, "unable to set
          effective uid to 0: Operation not permitted", which has now been
          silenced. [GL #1042] [GL #1090]

        <para>
          When <command>named-checkconf -z</command> was run, it would sometimes
          incorrectly set its exit code. It reflected the status of the last
          view found; if zone-loading errors were found in earlier configured
          views but not in the last one, the exit code indicated success.
          Thanks to Graham Clinch. [GL #1807]

          When built without LMDB support, <command>named</command> failed to
          restart after a zone with a double quote (") in its name was added
          with <command>rndc addzone</command>. Thanks to Alberto Fern√°ndez.
