          Parsing of LOC records was made more strict by rejecting a sole period
          (<userinput>.</userinput>) and/or <userinput>m</userinput> as a value.
          These changes prevent zone files using such values from being loaded.
          Handling of negative altitudes which are not integers was also
          corrected. [GL #2074]
