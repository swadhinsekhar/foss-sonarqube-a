  <para>
    With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
    source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
    Public License (MPL 2.0).
  </para>
  <para>
    The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
    licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
    your organization, that you publish those changes under that
    same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
    anything other than the changes you made to our software.
  </para>
  <para>
    This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND, with
    or without modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone
    redistributing it without changes. Therefore, this change will be
    without consequence for most individuals and organizations who are
    using BIND.
  </para>
  <para>
    Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
    use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
    license may contact ISC at <link
